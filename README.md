# ConnectFour

https://peterpooyising.github.io/ConnectFour/

This is a project that I did after the bootcamp to explore things which were not taught/used much during my Bootcamp 
- Javascript and Algorithms

I decided to create a game because I like developing games(aside from creating websites). I chose
ConnectFour because it was my favourite childhood game. The code is written in vanilla Javascript.

I have not implemented the AI function yet(I will do so in the future with more knowledge on AI).
