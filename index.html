    <!-- Put own JS script below before <body> so that the browser executes our JS script only after the whole DOM is loaded. If we place it in the <head> of the html, the script will access an element even before it has actually been rendered in the DOM, so will end up seeing the null reference error. Or can use:
        window.onload = function() {
        }
